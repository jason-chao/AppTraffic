# AppTraffic

AppTraffic is a scalable research tool for studying the network traffic of mobile applications (apps).  AppTraffic provides an easy-to-use user interface which enables researchers from different backgrounds to capture and make sense of network traffic.  AppTraffic integrates Softether and MITMProxy to allow for multiple research sessions.  The public IP address of the mobile device may be changed by routing the traffic to different exit nodes.
